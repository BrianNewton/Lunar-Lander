# Lunar-Lander
This project was my submission for my grade 12 culminating project for computer science. It is a iteration of the classic arcade game Lunar Lander.
# Gameplay
- The user controls a moon lander with limited fuel capacity
- The user has control over the lander's thrust with the space bar as well as it's rotation with arrow keys
- With these two controls, the user must touch the lander down safely to progress
- To touch down safely, the user must land at a slow enough speed and with a small enough angle with the ground
- Once the user lands, they progress to the next level, where the terrain becomes increasingly dangerous
- The user's score is determined by the current level as well as the remaining fuel
# Software
- Uses the JavaFX graphics library for 2D graphics
- Uses collision detection to detect when the user touches down
- Uses KeyFrames to achieve animation
- Logs user high scores in a seperate text file which can be viewed in-game
